1.1 Aim 
The aim of this project is the analyze and compare the existing intrusion detection models and to develop an ensemble stacking model using the results of base models like Logistic regression, Random Forest and Neural network to improve the overall accuracy of the model that is trained to detect benign and DDOS attacks. 
 
 
 

1.2 Objectives:   
The main objectives are:   
1.	To find an appropriate dataset to train and test the Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Neural Network models to detect Benign and attacks. 
2.	To aggregate rows the in dataset based on certain key features as a process of data preprocessing.  
3.	To evaluate the performance of each model based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score and confusion metrics 
4.	To combine the predictions made by the models to create an ensemble stacking model in order to improve the overall accuracy of the model. 
5.	To critically analyze the existing intrusion detection models using machine learning based on their performances.
